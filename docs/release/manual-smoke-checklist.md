# Manual Smoke Checklist — v0.1.0

This checklist gates the v0.1.0 tag push (D-M9-14). Tasks 1-11 of M9 land
freely without it; Task 12 step 5 requires every box ticked AND a reviewer
signature at the bottom.

If any pre-requisite is unavailable, STOP. Park the release on a
`release/v0.1.0` branch and resume when the human reviewer has the live
setup. Tag NEVER pushes without smoke.

---

## Pre-requisites

- [ ] **Real terminal** (TTY-attached, NOT a CI runner or background shell). The
      TUI flows require a real terminal for cursor / size events / approval banner
      rendering.
- [ ] **Live orchestrator** reachable at `SOPHIA_ORCHESTRATOR_URL` (or the
      default `http://localhost:9080`). Start it via the Sophia stack ahead of
      time (typically `sophia start` or whatever your orchestrator-side runbook
      says).
- [ ] **`.sophia.yaml`** present in the working directory the smoke is run from.
      Either run `sophia init` once or hand-write the file with `version: 1`,
      `project: <name>`, `base_ref: main`, `artifact_store: engram`.
- [ ] **At least one in-progress Change** (status `running` or `blocked`).
      Easiest path: kick off a Change with `sophia run "smoke v0.1.0 in-progress"`
      and let it stop part-way (Q-detach).
- [ ] **At least one terminal Change** (status `done`, `failed`, or `blocked`).
      Pick one from the orchestrator history (`sophia changes`).
- [ ] **At least one Change pending approval** (status `running`,
      `current_phase` is `apply` or whichever phase the orchestrator gates).
      If your orchestrator doesn't produce one organically, stub it on the
      orchestrator side or temporarily skip the eager-arm bullet below and note
      the gap in sign-off.
- [ ] `./bin/sophia` built from the M9 tip (`make build`). `sophia version`
      reports `0.1.0-dev` (the `make build` ldflags inject `0.1.0-dev`; the
      release workflow injects the real `v0.1.0` at tag push).

## Smoke matrix

### Environment

- [ ] `sophia doctor` → green across every check (Docker daemon, git, paths,
      orchestrator reachable, SSE handshake).

### `sophia run`

- [ ] `sophia run "smoke v0.1.0"` opens the TUI. Timeline updates as phases
      stream in. `Q` detaches cleanly. Reattach hint printed to stderr.
- [ ] `sophia run "smoke" --no-tui --json` streams JSONL to stdout. `head -1`
      shows the snapshot row; later lines show events. Last line carries
      `final_status` once the Change reaches a terminal status.

### `sophia attach`

- [ ] `sophia attach <running-id>` opens the TUI and reattaches to the live
      stream. `Q` detaches cleanly. The reattach hint is identical to `run`.
- [ ] `sophia attach <terminal-id>` opens the TUI, renders the snapshot, and
      immediately closes (OnComplete fires; finishWithSink returns code 0).
      No SSE subscription appears in orchestrator logs.
- [ ] `sophia attach <pending-approval-id> --no-tui --json --approval-timeout 60s`
      eager-arms the timer (synthetic `gate` row prints early). If the gate is
      resolved before 60s → exit 0. If not → exit 5 after exactly 60s. The
      "from attach time, not original event time" guarantee (D-M8-13).
- [ ] `sophia attach MISSING-ID --no-tui --json` → exit 3 with `change not found`
      message, no JSONL output beyond an `error` row.

### `sophia changes`

- [ ] `sophia changes` → table aligns. Header row: `ID  STATUS  PROJECT  BASE_REF
      CREATED_AT`. Rows render correctly even when `BaseRef` or timestamps are
      missing.
- [ ] `sophia changes --json | python3 -m json.tool` → exits 0; output is a
      valid JSON array of `change_id` objects.
- [ ] `sophia changes --status running` → only `running` rows appear.
- [ ] `sophia changes --limit 3` → at most 3 rows.
- [ ] `sophia changes --project ""` → no project filter; rows from every project
      appear.
- [ ] `sophia changes` (in a directory WITHOUT `.sophia.yaml`) → stderr warning
      "project default unavailable"; stdout still lists all projects (lenient
      fall-through per cambio 4 — only `status` is strict).

### `sophia status`

- [ ] `sophia status` (in a project dir, after a `run`) → shows the
      project-scoped Change. `Source: project`.
- [ ] `sophia status` (in a project dir without ever running) → falls back to
      `Source: global`.
- [ ] `sophia status` (outside any git repo) → falls back to `Source: global`.
- [ ] `sophia status` (no global state, e.g. fresh `XDG_STATE_HOME=$(mktemp -d)`)
      → exit 0, prints `No local change found.`.
- [ ] `sophia status <id>` → flag-source wins. `Source: flag`.
- [ ] `sophia status --json | python3 -m json.tool` → valid JSON object.
- [ ] `sophia status --json` (empty result) → emits `null` (a single line).

### Failure paths

- [ ] **Stale local last_change_id**: `echo "BOGUS-ID" >
      $XDG_STATE_HOME/sophia/last_change_id; sophia status` → exit 3 with
      `change not found`. Recovery instruction (`sophia changes --limit 1`)
      mentioned in stderr.
- [ ] **Malformed `.sophia.yaml`**: edit the file to introduce a YAML parse
      error; `sophia status` → exit 3 with the parse error wrapped in
      `project config invalid` (cambio 4 strict mode).
- [ ] **Orchestrator down**: `SOPHIA_ORCHESTRATOR_URL=http://127.0.0.1:1 sophia
      status MISSING` → exit 3 with `connection refused` or similar.

### `sophia init`

- [ ] In a fresh git repo: `sophia init` → writes `.sophia.yaml` with
      detected `project: <repo-name>`, `base_ref: main`,
      `artifact_store: engram`.
- [ ] `sophia init --force` overwrites an existing `.sophia.yaml`.
- [ ] `sophia init` outside a git repo → exit 3 with friendly error.

## Stub-orchestrator smoke — 2026-05-07

A second automated pass was run against an **in-process stub orchestrator**
(see `/tmp/orch-stub/main.go`) that honors the wire protocol sophia-cli
expects: `GET /api/v1/healthz`, `GET /api/v1/events`, `POST /api/v1/changes`,
`GET /api/v1/changes`, `GET /api/v1/changes/{id}`, `GET /api/v1/changes/{id}/events`.
The stub returns a deterministic happy-path: every POST creates a `running`
Change, the SSE endpoint emits one `phase.completed` then closes, the
post-stream `GetChange` returns `done`. Subsequent `/events` reconnects
return 401 to terminate the SSE retry loop fast (mirrors
`test/e2e/attach_workflow_test.go`).

**Caveat:** this is NOT the real orchestrator. It validates that sophia-cli
correctly speaks the wire protocol; it does NOT validate that the real
orchestrator's behavior matches the spec. Live-orchestrator validation by
the human reviewer remains the canonical M9 gate before any production
release announcement.

### Stub smoke results

| Bullet | Command | Result | Exit | Notes |
|--------|---------|--------|------|-------|
| `sophia doctor` | `./bin/sophia doctor` | OK | 0 | 6 ok / 0 fail. XDG dirs created with 0700 perms. |
| `sophia run` JSONL | `sophia run "smoke v0.1.0" --no-tui --json` | OK | 0 | snapshot → event → snapshot(done) → complete final_status=done. |
| `sophia attach` JSONL (running → done) | `sophia attach STUB-001 --no-tui --json` | OK | 0 | Stub already terminal at attach time → snapshot + complete; short-circuit path. |
| `sophia attach MISSING` | `sophia attach MISSING --no-tui --json` | OK | 3 | 404 mapped to ExitError{Code: 3} per spec §2.3. |
| `sophia changes` table | `sophia changes` | OK | 0 | Header + 1 row aligned. |
| `sophia changes --json` valid JSON | `sophia changes --json \| python3 -m json.tool` | OK | 0 | Valid array; one item; all expected fields present. |
| `sophia status` project-scoped | `cd /tmp/smoke && sophia status` | OK | 0 | `Source: project` after run persisted last_change_id. |
| `sophia status <id>` flag | `sophia status STUB-001` | OK | 0 | `Source: flag` overrides project-scoped. |
| `sophia status --json` populated | `sophia status STUB-001 --json` | OK | 0 | Valid JSON object; all fields present. |

### NOT EXECUTED in stub smoke (require real terminal + live orchestrator)

- TUI flows: `sophia run` default-mode, `sophia attach <id>` default-mode (need TTY for bubbletea).
- `sophia attach <pending-approval-id> --approval-timeout` D-M8-13 eager-arm — stub does not produce a `PhaseStatusBlocked` snapshot; would need orchestrator with real approval gate.
- `--approval-timeout` exit 5 — orchestrator-side gate required.
- Stale `last_change_id` recovery — testable headless but not in this run.
- Malformed `.sophia.yaml` exit 3 (cambio 4 strict mode) — testable headless but not in this run.

## Automated headless smoke — 2026-05-07

The bullets below were executed automatically against `./bin/sophia` built
from `release/v0.1.0` HEAD on 2026-05-07. **Orchestrator was unavailable**
(docker daemon down + nothing listening on `:9080`), so every bullet that
requires orchestrator-side state is marked **NOT EXECUTED — human gate**.
The headless results are recorded here for traceability; they do NOT
constitute the manual smoke sign-off.

### Headless results

| Bullet | Result | Exit | Notes |
|--------|--------|------|-------|
| `sophia version` | OK | 0 | `sophia 0.1.0-dev (commit 2123edd, built 2026-05-07T09:51:58Z)` — ldflags injection works. |
| `sophia --help` | OK | 0 | All 9 commands listed (attach/changes/completion/doctor/help/init/run/start/status/stop/version); no "M8 stub". |
| `sophia changes --help` | OK | 0 | 4 flags present: `--limit`, `--status`, `--project`, `--json`. |
| `sophia attach --help` | OK | 0 | 3 M8 flags present: `--approval-timeout`, `--json`, `--no-tui`. |
| `XDG_STATE_HOME=$(mktemp -d) sophia status` (empty) | OK | 0 | Prints `No local change found.` per spec §2.5 empty-resolution. |
| `sophia status MISSING --json` (orchestrator down) | OK | 3 | Error mapped to exit 3 (orchestrator unreachable per spec §2.3). |
| `sophia attach MISSING --no-tui --json` | OK | 3 | Same exit-3 mapping. |
| `sophia changes` (orchestrator down) | OK | 3 | Same exit-3 mapping (vs the lenient warn-and-fall-through cambio 4 path which only applies on `.sophia.yaml` parse error). |

### NOT EXECUTED — human gate (require live orchestrator + real terminal)

- `sophia doctor` green-across — needs orchestrator + docker daemon.
- `sophia run "smoke v0.1.0"` TUI flow — needs orchestrator + TTY.
- `sophia run --no-tui --json` JSONL flow — needs orchestrator.
- `sophia attach <running-id>` TUI reattach — needs orchestrator + TTY.
- `sophia attach <terminal-id>` immediate close — needs orchestrator.
- `sophia attach <pending-approval-id> --approval-timeout 60s` (D-M8-13 eager-arm) — needs orchestrator with a Change pending approval.
- `sophia changes --status running` filter pass-through — needs orchestrator with running Changes.
- `sophia changes --json | python3 -m json.tool` valid JSON — needs orchestrator with at least one Change.
- `sophia status` (project-scoped fallback) — needs persisted Change ID + orchestrator to fetch.
- `sophia status --json` populated → valid JSON object — needs orchestrator.
- Stale `last_change_id` recovery message — needs orchestrator to confirm 404 messaging.
- Malformed `.sophia.yaml` → exit 3 (cambio 4 strict mode) — can be tested headless but was not in this run; trivial to add if needed pre-tag.
- `sophia init` in fresh git repo — testable headless; not in this run.
- `sophia init --force` overwrite — testable headless; not in this run.
